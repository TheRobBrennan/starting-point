### Available Test Commands

- `npm test` - Run all workflow tests
- `npm run test:workflows` - Test all workflows
- `npm run test:workflows:semantic` - Test semantic PR check with minor version bump
- `npm run test:workflows:semantic:major` - Test semantic PR check with major version bump
- `npm run test:workflows:semantic:minor` - Test semantic PR check with minor version bump
- `npm run test:workflows:semantic:patch` - Test semantic PR check with patch version bump
- `npm run test:workflows:semantic:invalid` - Test semantic PR check with invalid PR title
- `npm run test:workflows:merge` - Test merge workflow

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions

This repository includes the following GitHub Actions workflows:

- **Main Merge**: Handles version bumping and changelog generation on merge to main

## üìã Using This Template

### Getting Started with Your New Project

1. **Create a new repository from this template**
   - Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub, or
   - Clone this repository and push it to a new repository

2. **Customize the template for your project**

   - Add your project files
   - Use the pre-configured GitHub workflows for PR validation and versioning

### Customizing GitHub Workflows

The template includes two main workflows:

1. **Semantic PR Check** (`.github/workflows/semantic-pr-check.yml`)
   - Validates that PR titles follow conventional commit format
   - Customize validation rules if needed

2. **Main Merge** (`.github/workflows/main-merge.yml`)
   - Automatically creates version bump PRs after merges to main
   - Adjusts version based on commit type (feat, fix, etc.)
   - Customize the version bump behavior if needed
